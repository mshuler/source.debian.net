Installation
------------
  Copy this directory tree to /srv/source.debian.net. Or else hunt for
  all the hard-coded paths.

  bin/downloaddebian is the script responsible for downloading and
  extracting the packages. Edit the top of the script to select your
  preferred mirror and the desired distributions.

  Installing OpenGrok. I used OpenGrok 0.7. First, recompile it with
  the patch described below. Edit the web.xml file to point to the
  configuration file (.../etc/opengrok-config.xml). Then copy the
  source.war file to Tomcat's webapp dir. The other binaries can be
  installed wherever you want.

  You'll have to configure Tomcat's security settings. See the
  OpenGrok website.

  Two caveats:

  - If OpenGrok runs out of memory, it dies silently. Nothing is logged
    in this case. This happened for me with a handful of files in the
    archive, for example one of the gnuchess data files. In the src/
    directory is a patch that catches the out-of-memory exception and
    continues with the next file instead.

  - Exuberant Ctags (used by OpenGrok when indexing) sometimes gets
    stuck in an infinite loop. The safe-exctags program is a wrapper
    which kills the process if it takes more than a couple of minutes.

  bin/crontab is a script you can run whenever you want to refresh the
  website.  Edit it to set the place where you've installed OpenGrok.
